This is a mobile application created with React Native. 
The application allows users to play with the existing cards ands decks, 
and also allows them to create new decks and new cards.

- Deck (Contains the individual deck where users can add cards or start quiz)
- AddCard (allow users to add new card)
- AddDeck (Allow users to add new deck)
- Card (where users can play quiz and get results)
